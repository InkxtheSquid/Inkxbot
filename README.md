# Inkxbot
Inkxbot is a Discord bot that can read the Splatoon schedule, send information on Hearthstone Cards, read The Just Dance Wiki, and more! (the bot is still in development)

This repository is where I show Inkxbot's code, I would rather you didn't run an instant copy of my bot, but rather added it though its invite link which can be found [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=245648163837444097&scope=bot "Invite Inkxbot!").
The source code is here just to show my progress on my bot and have a webhook send a message to the bot's home server.

Also, the rewrite branch is for a little bit of teaching of the discord.py library rewrite too.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5+
- discord.py rewrite
- pyChallonge
