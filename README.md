# Inkxbot
Inkxbot is a discord bot that can read the Splatoon schedule, send information on Hearthstone Cards, read The Just Dance Wiki, and More!(the bot is still in development)

this is the repository is where I show Inkxbot's code, I rather that you don't run a instant copy of my bot,
the source code is here just to show my progress on my bot and have a webhook send a message to the bot's home server.

also, the rewrite branch is for a little bit of teaching of the discord.py library rewrite too.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5+
- discord.py rewrite
- lxml ~~not used that much lol~~
- pyChallonge
- Selenium WebDriver
